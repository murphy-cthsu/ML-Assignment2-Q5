# Submission Format Fix - Summary

## ✅ What Was Fixed

Your `submission.csv` now matches the exact format of `submission_sample.csv`.

### Key Issue Identified:
The `submission_sample.csv` uses **lexicographic (string) sorting**, NOT numeric sorting!

**Example:**
- Lexicographic order: 1, 10, 100, 101, ..., 11, 110, ..., 2, 20, 200, ...
- Numeric order: 1, 2, 3, ..., 10, 11, ..., 100, 101, ...

## 🔧 Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Current Submission
Sorted your existing `submission.csv` lexicographically:
```bash
# Before: 1, 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, 11, ...
# After:  1, 10, 100, 101, ..., 11, 110, ..., 2, 20, ...
```

### 2. Updated Inference Script
Modified `infer_style.py` to automatically sort predictions lexicographically:
```python
# Now includes this step:
predictions_sorted = sorted(predictions, key=lambda x: str(x[0]))
```

## 📋 Format Verification

### Your Submission (NOW):
```csv
id,label
1,144
10,526
100,270
101,388
...
```

### Sample Submission:
```csv
id,label
1,54
10,275
100,90
101,418
...
```

✅ **ID ordering matches perfectly!**

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Training Data Issue

Your score is 0 because you trained on **test_set/query_set** instead of **train_set/**.

### Problem:
```bash
# WRONG (what you did):
--train_dir test_set/query_set  # Test players - model overfits to them

# CORRECT (what you should do):
--train_dir train_set/           # Training players - model learns general features
```

### Why This Matters:
1. You trained on query set (600 players)
2. At inference:
   - Query players: Model recognizes them (seen during training)
   - Candidate players: Model never saw them (random embeddings)
3. Matching known vs unknown = **meaningless results**

### Solution:
Train on `train_set/` so the model learns **general style features**, not specific player identities.

## 🚀 Next Steps

### 1. Train Correctly with Validation
```bash
cd /home/cthsu/Workspace/ML_2025/HW2/Q5
./train_correct.sh medium
```

This will:
- Train on `train_set/` (correct data)
- Run validation every 5 epochs
- Show Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy
- Monitor if model is learning meaningful styles

### 2. Monitor Training
```bash
# Watch progress
tail -f training_with_val.log

# Check validation metrics
cat models/medium_with_val/training_log.txt
```

Expected validation metrics after training:
- **Top-1 Accuracy**: 60-85% (same player ranks #1)
- **Top-5 Accuracy**: 85-97% (same player in top 5)
- **Same Similarity**: > 0.7 (same player's games are similar)
- **Diff Similarity**: < 0.4 (different players less similar)

### 3. Re-run Inference
```bash
# After training completes
python infer_style.py \
    --model_path models/medium_with_val/best_model.pth \
    --query_dir test_set/query_set \
    --candidate_dir test_set/cand_set \
    --output submission.csv
```

The output will now:
- ✅ Use properly trained model
- ✅ Be sorted lexicographically
- ✅ Match submission_sample.csv format exactly

## 📊 Expected Results

With correct training, you should see:
- **Score > 0** (actual matches found)
- Many query players correctly matched to themselves (query and candidate are same 600 people)
- Similar style players matched even if not exact same person

## 🔍 Debugging Checklist

- [x] Submission format matches (lexicographic sorting)
- [x] Submission has 600 rows + header = 601 lines total
- [x] All IDs are 1-600 (1-indexed)
- [ ] **Trained on train_set/ NOT test_set/query_set**
- [ ] Validation shows increasing accuracy during training
- [ ] Same player's games have high similarity (> 0.7)
- [ ] Model outputs normalized embeddings

## 📝 Key Takeaways

1. **Submission format**: Lexicographic sorting (1, 10, 100, ..., 2, 20, ...)
2. **Training data**: Must use `train_set/` not `test_set/query_set`
3. **Validation**: Essential to verify model learns meaningful features
4. **Embeddings**: Should cluster same player's games, separate different players

Your submission.csv is now formatted correctly! Once you retrain on the correct data, you should get a non-zero score. 🎯
