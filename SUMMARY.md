## 🎯 How It Works

### The Approach

This system uses **metric learning** to learn a style embedding space where:
- Positions played by the same player are close together
- Positions played by different players are far apart

### The Pipeline

```
Training Phase:
1. Load SGF files → Board positions (C++ module)
2. Sample positions from each game
3. Create triplets (anchor, positive, negative)
4. Train CNN to minimize triplet loss
5. Save best model

Inference Phase:
1. Load trained model
2. Extract embeddings for all query players
3. Extract embeddings for all candidate players
4. Compute similarity matrix (cosine similarity)
5. Rank candidates for each query
6. Output top-5 matches per query
```

## 🚀 How to Use

### Quick Test (5 minutes)
```bash
# Verify setup
python test_system.py

# Quick training
python train_style_model.py --model_type triplet --epochs 5 --batch_size 16 \
    --output_dir models/test

# Run inference
python infer_style.py --model_path models/test/best_model.pth \
    --output submission.csv
```

### Full Training (1-2 hours)
```bash
# Train with recommended settings
python train_style_model.py \
    --model_type triplet \
    --epochs 50 \
    --batch_size 32 \
    --hidden_channels 256 \
    --num_blocks 10 \
    --embedding_dim 512 \
    --learning_rate 0.001 \
    --output_dir models/final_model

# Generate submission
python infer_style.py \
    --model_path models/final_model/best_model.pth \
    --query_dir test_set/query_set \
    --candidate_dir test_set/cand_set \
    --output submission.csv
```

## 📊 Technical Details

### Model Architecture
- **Input**: 18-channel board representation (19×19)
- **Encoder**: 
  - Initial conv: 18 → 256 channels
  - 10 residual blocks (default)
  - Global average pooling
  - FC layer: 256 → 512
  - L2 normalization
- **Output**: 512-dim style embedding (configurable)

### Training Strategy (Triplet Loss)
- **Anchor**: Random position from player A
- **Positive**: Different position from player A
- **Negative**: Random position from player B
- **Loss**: `max(0, d(a,p) - d(a,n) + margin)`
- **Optimization**: Adam with learning rate scheduling

### Data Processing
- Positions sampled evenly across game progression
- Default: 10 frames per game
- Automatic data augmentation (random rotations)
- Batch processing for efficiency

## 🎓 Key Design Decisions

### 1. Why Triplet Loss?
- **Better for similarity matching** than classification
- Learns a metric space optimized for comparison
- Doesn't need to predict exact player ID
- More robust to unseen players

### 2. Why ResNet Architecture?
- **Proven effective** for image-like data (Go boards)
- Skip connections prevent vanishing gradients
- Allows deep networks (10+ layers)
- Standard in computer vision

### 3. Why L2 Normalization?
- **Fair comparison** of embeddings
- Cosine similarity reduces to dot product
- Prevents magnitude from affecting similarity
- Common in face recognition systems

### 4. Why Average Embeddings?
- **More robust** than single position
- Captures overall style across game
- Reduces noise from individual moves
- Similar to speaker recognition systems
